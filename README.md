SURFTUGA WPF
üåä Welcome to Surftuga WPF!
This is a simple game developed in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) where you control a surfing turtle that must dodge obstacles while the background moves faster and faster.

üéÆ Game Description
The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by dodging randomly appearing obstacles. The background speed increases over time, making the game more challenging. Aim for the highest score!
